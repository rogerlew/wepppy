## Notes for Next Pass
- Static assets now build via `wctl build-static-assets`; re-run before image rebuilds so `controllers.js` and vendor bundles stay current.
- Kubernetes migration is still pending. When that work resumes, plan on duplicating the static build stage so the proxy image (or init container) ships with the same `/weppcloud/static` tree baked inâ€”no shared volumes required.
