# PROJECT_TRACKER.md
> Kanban board for wepppy work packages and vision items

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25  
**Active Packages**: 3  
**Quick Links**: [Work Packages Directory](docs/work-packages/) | [God-Tier Prompting Strategy](docs/god-tier-prompting-strategy.md)

## Purpose

This tracker provides a high-level view of active and planned work packages for both human and AI agents. When starting a session, agents should check this tracker to understand current initiatives and avoid duplicate work.

## How to Use This Tracker

**For Agents**:
- Check "In Progress" when starting work to see what's active
- Review "Backlog" to understand planned work
- Update package status when starting or completing work
- Add new packages to "Backlog" when scoping new initiatives
- Move packages between columns as they progress

**For Humans**:
- Get a quick snapshot of active development
- Understand what's coming next
- See what's been recently completed
- Identify opportunities to contribute

**Package Lifecycle**:
1. Start in **Backlog** (scoped but not started)
2. Move to **In Progress** when work begins
3. Move to **Done** when complete (leave for 30 days, then archive to History)

## Kanban Principles Applied

### 1. Visualize Work
This tracker makes all work visible at a glance, helping agents coordinate and avoiding duplicate effort.

### 2. Limit Work in Progress
**Target**: 2-4 active packages maximum to maintain focus and ensure packages complete rather than stall.

**Current WIP**: 2 packages

If WIP exceeds 4, prioritize completing existing packages before starting new ones. This prevents context switching overhead and ensures clean handoffs.

### 3. Manage Flow
Monitor how long packages spend in each column:
- **Backlog ‚Üí In Progress**: Should happen when capacity available and dependencies met
- **In Progress ‚Üí Done**: Target 2-4 weeks for most packages; >6 weeks suggests scope issues

Blockers should be explicitly noted in package tracker.md and surfaced here if they affect multiple packages.

### 4. Make Process Policies Explicit
All policies are documented:
- Package structure: `docs/work-packages/README.md`
- Agent workflow: `AGENTS.md` (Creating a Work Package section)
- Prompt crafting: `docs/god-tier-prompting-strategy.md`
- Templates: `docs/prompt_templates/`

When agents encounter unclear policies, they should update the relevant documentation immediately.

### 5. Implement Feedback Loops
Feedback mechanisms:
- **Package tracker.md**: Decision logs and progress notes capture what's working/not working
- **Lessons learned**: Package closure notes document insights for future work
- **Agent collaboration**: Agents encouraged to suggest improvements when they stumble
- **This tracker**: Review periodically to identify patterns in blocked/stalled work

### 6. Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally
**Continuous improvement culture**:
- Agents have authority to correct/improve documentation when gaps are found
- Stumbling is a system failure, not agent failure
- Every agent should leave the system slightly better than they found it
- Experimental approaches are encouraged; document outcomes in tracker.md

**Feedback welcome**: If this tracker format doesn't work, propose improvements in a package tracker or directly update this file.

## üìã Backlog

Work packages that are scoped but not yet started. Dependencies and prerequisites should be noted.

### markdown-doc Toolkit
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Backlog - Requirements Complete  
**Size**: Medium
**Owner**: gpt-5-codex spec review and lead developer, github copilot (Claude 4.5 Sonnet) spec and testing
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251025_markdown_doc_toolkit/](docs/work-packages/20251025_markdown_doc_toolkit/)  
**Description**: Build comprehensive Rust CLI for documentation management: catalog generation, link validation, safe file moves, TOC maintenance, and search.

**Scope**:
- `catalog` - Generate `DOC_CATALOG.md` with file list + TOCs
- `lint` - Validate links, heading hierarchy, required sections
- `toc` - Generate/update table of contents
- `mv` - Move/rename files with automatic link updates
- `refs` - Find references to files/sections
- `search` - Full-text search across documentation
- `validate` - Template compliance checking

**Strategic Value**: Reduces documentation maintenance burden by 80%, enables safe refactoring, prevents broken links in CI, improves discoverability for 388+ markdown files.

**Dependencies**: None (leverages existing markdown-extract/markdown-edit patterns)

**Next Steps**:
- Finalize CLI command surface and exit codes
- gpt-5-codex review
- Design `.markdown-doc.toml` configuration schema
- Handover to gpt-5-codex for MVP implementation (`catalog`, `toc`, `lint` broken-links)

**Current Work**:
- üîß Sort out miscellaneous rendering bugs across controllers
- üîß Validate reports (WEPP reports, loss summaries, visualizations)

**Next Steps**:
- Complete rendering bug fixes and visual validation
- Polish controller documentation
- Finalize verification checklist
- Close package when all reports validated and rendering stable

## ‚úÖ Done

Recently completed work packages. Archive to History section after 30 days.

### NoDb ACID Transaction Update
**Completed**: 2025-10-25  
**Duration**: 1 day (planning only)  
**Status**: ‚ùå **CANCELLED - Unviable**  
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251024_nodb_acid_update/](docs/work-packages/20251024_nodb_acid_update/)  
**Description**: Proposed Redis-backed ACID transactions for NoDb controllers with intelligent event-driven cache invalidation.

**Outcome**: After architectural review, the proposed specification was deemed unviable. The approach introduced excessive complexity without sufficient benefit. NoDb's existing file-based state management with Redis locking remains the architectural pattern.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Redis transactions don't provide the durability guarantees needed for NoDb's file-first architecture
- Cache invalidation rules added complexity without addressing core concurrency patterns
- File-based state with explicit locking is simpler and more maintainable
- Future caching improvements should focus on read-through patterns, not transaction wrappers

### StatusStream Telemetry Cleanup
**Completed**: 2025-10-23  
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251023_statusstream_cleanup/](docs/work-packages/20251023_statusstream_cleanup/)  
**Description**: Replaced legacy WSClient shim with unified controlBase.attach_status_stream helper.

**Outcome**: Unified telemetry pipeline with no WSClient references; all controllers use StatusStream.

---

### Controller Modernization Documentation Backlog
**Completed**: 2025-02-14  
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251023_controller_modernization/](docs/work-packages/20251023_controller_modernization/)  
**Description**: Consolidated controller modernization documentation after WSClient removal and helper-first migration.

**Outcome**: Authoritative helper-first documentation established; archived per-controller plans grouped within work package.

## üìù Notes

### When to Update This Tracker

**Agents should update this tracker when**:
- Starting a new work package (add to Backlog or In Progress)
- Moving a package between columns (Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done)
- Significant progress on an active package (update "Recent Progress")
- Blocking issues that affect package status
- Package completion (move to Done, add outcome summary)

**Frequency**: Check and update during each work session that touches work packages.

### Archive Policy

Move packages from "Done" to "History" section (below) after 30 days. This keeps the tracker focused on recent/active work while preserving completion history.

### Questions or Issues

If this tracker format isn't working or you have suggestions:
1. Create a work package for "PROJECT_TRACKER improvements"
2. Document specific pain points and proposed solutions
3. Experiment with changes and gather feedback
