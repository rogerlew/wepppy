# PROJECT_TRACKER.md
> Kanban board for wepppy work packages and vision items

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27  
**Active Packages**: 3  
**Quick Links**: [Work Packages Directory](docs/work-packages/) | [God-Tier Prompting Strategy](docs/god-tier-prompting-strategy.md)

## Purpose

This tracker provides a high-level view of active and planned work packages for both human and AI agents. When starting a session, agents should check this tracker to understand current initiatives and avoid duplicate work.

## How to Use This Tracker

**For Agents**:
- Check "In Progress" when starting work to see what's active
- Review "Backlog" to understand planned work
- Update package status when starting or completing work
- Add new packages to "Backlog" when scoping new initiatives
- Move packages between columns as they progress

**For Humans**:
- Get a quick snapshot of active development
- Understand what's coming next
- See what's been recently completed
- Identify opportunities to contribute

**Package Lifecycle**:
1. Start in **Backlog** (scoped but not started)
2. Move to **In Progress** when work begins
3. Move to **Done** when complete (leave for 30 days, then archive to History)

## Kanban Principles Applied

### 1. Visualize Work
This tracker makes all work visible at a glance, helping agents coordinate and avoiding duplicate effort.

### 2. Limit Work in Progress
**Target**: 2-4 active packages maximum to maintain focus and ensure packages complete rather than stall.

**Current WIP**: 3 packages ✅ **Within target**

If WIP exceeds 4, prioritize completing existing packages before starting new ones. This prevents context switching overhead and ensures clean handoffs.

### 3. Manage Flow
Monitor how long packages spend in each column:
- **Backlog → In Progress**: Should happen when capacity available and dependencies met
- **In Progress → Done**: Target 2-4 weeks for most packages; >6 weeks suggests scope issues

Blockers should be explicitly noted in package tracker.md and surfaced here if they affect multiple packages.

### 4. Make Process Policies Explicit
All policies are documented:
- Package structure: `docs/work-packages/README.md`
- Agent workflow: `AGENTS.md` (Creating a Work Package section)
- Prompt crafting: `docs/god-tier-prompting-strategy.md`
- Templates: `docs/prompt_templates/`

When agents encounter unclear policies, they should update the relevant documentation immediately.

### 5. Implement Feedback Loops
Feedback mechanisms:
- **Package tracker.md**: Decision logs and progress notes capture what's working/not working
- **Lessons learned**: Package closure notes document insights for future work
- **Agent collaboration**: Agents encouraged to suggest improvements when they stumble
- **This tracker**: Review periodically to identify patterns in blocked/stalled work

### 6. Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally
**Continuous improvement culture**:
- Agents have authority to correct/improve documentation when gaps are found
- Stumbling is a system failure, not agent failure
- Every agent should leave the system slightly better than they found it
- Experimental approaches are encouraged; document outcomes in tracker.md

**Feedback welcome**: If this tracker format doesn't work, propose improvements in a package tracker or directly update this file.

## 📋 Backlog

Work packages that are scoped but not yet started. Dependencies and prerequisites should be noted.

### Wojak Lives: Interactive Agent Integration
**Proposed**: 2025-10-28  
**Size**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**Priority**: High  
**Package**: [docs/work-packages/20251028_wojak_lives/](docs/work-packages/20251028_wojak_lives/)  
**Description**: Establish minimal viable path for Wojak agent (zero-trust public-facing tier) integration with WEPPcloud command bar.

**Scope**:
- JWT authentication scoped to user + run context
- MCP modules for file access (`report_files`) and markdown editing (`report_editor`) using PyO3 bindings
- Flask route to spawn CAO sessions with JWT injection
- Command bar UI integration with WebSocket bridge for bi-directional chat
- Security validation (path traversal prevention, JWT verification)
- Manual smoke testing with root user (Roger)

**Strategic Value**:
- Enables interactive agent assistance for WEPP run exploration
- Demonstrates CAO integration with WEPPcloud UI
- Establishes security patterns for future agent tiers
- Leverages PyO3 markdown bindings for 50× performance improvement over subprocess calls

**Dependencies**: 
- CAO server running on localhost:9889
- PyO3 bindings installed in CAO venv (markdown_extract_py, markdown_edit_py, markdown_doc_py)
- Flask-JWT-Extended library
- Sample run directory with markdown reports for testing

**Codex Review Gate**: Pause after Phase 1 (Backend Foundation) if effort exceeds 12 hours for architecture validation before frontend work.

### Deprecate and Remove TauDEM Backend
**Proposed**: 2025-10-27  
**Size**: Medium (3-5 days)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: The `TauDEM` watershed delineation backend is deprecated and should be removed from the codebase to reduce complexity and maintenance overhead.

**Scope**:
- Remove all code paths related to `DelineationBackend.TauDEM` in `wepppy/nodb/core/watershed.py`.
- Delete any TauDEM-specific scripts, configuration, or workflow files.
- Ensure the `WBT` (WhiteboxTools) backend is the default and fully functional replacement for all use cases.
- Update documentation (e.g., `cicd-strategy.md`, `nodb-project-build.md`) to remove any references to TauDEM.

**Strategic Value**:
- Reduces technical debt and code complexity.
- Simplifies the watershed delineation logic and configuration.
- Lowers the maintenance burden for both developers and agents.
- Focuses testing and development efforts on the modern `WBT` backend.

**Dependencies**: Confirmation that the `WBT` backend fully covers all necessary functionality previously provided by `TauDEM`.

**Next Steps**: Create a work package to analyze the full impact of removal, verify WBT feature parity, and execute the removal.

### Jinja Template Lint Error Resolution
**Proposed**: 2025-10-27  
**Size**: Small (1-2 days)  
**Priority**: Low (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)  
**Description**: Resolve TypeScript/JavaScript linter false positives when parsing Jinja template syntax (`{{ ... | tojson }}`) inside `<script>` tags in `.htm` templates.

**Scope**:
- Move dynamic values from inline Jinja expressions to HTML data attributes
- Refactor JavaScript to read from data attributes instead of Jinja-injected constants
- Eliminate lint errors while maintaining template functionality
- Pattern applies to: `_base_report.htm`, potentially other report templates

**Strategic Value**: 
- Cleaner CI lint output
- Better developer experience (no false positive noise)
- More maintainable separation of template data and JavaScript logic
- Standard pattern for future template development

**Dependencies**: None

**Next Steps**: Create work package when bandwidth available; not blocking any current work

---

### Rename markdown-extract Repo to markdown-toolkit
**Proposed**: 2025-10-28  
**Size**: Small (1 hour)  
**Priority**: Low  
**Description**: Rename the `rogerlew/markdown-extract` repository to `rogerlew/markdown-toolkit` to reflect that it now includes three tools: `markdown-extract`, `markdown-edit`, and `markdown-doc`.

**Scope**:
- Rename GitHub repository via Settings → Rename
- Update README.md to reflect new name
- Update any documentation/references in wepppy that point to the old repo name
- GitHub automatically redirects old URLs, so existing links remain functional
- Update `tools/README.markdown-tools.md` references if needed

**Strategic Value**: 
- Accurate branding reflects toolkit nature (not just extraction)
- Clearer communication to users about available tools
- Better positioning for future tools (e.g., markdown-validate, markdown-toc)
- GitHub redirects preserve all existing links

**Dependencies**: None (safe operation, GitHub handles redirects)

**Next Steps**: Quick rename when convenient; very low risk


### Kubernetes Migration (Pending)
When resuming Kubernetes work:
- Duplicate static build stage for proxy image
- Use init containers for shared assets
- Eliminate shared volume mounts
- Configure Redis keyspace notifications in ConfigMap
- Set resource limits based on profiling

**Health Checks**:
- Endpoint: `/health`
- Returns 200 OK when ready
- Checks Redis connectivity
- Use for liveness/readiness probes

**Logging in Production**:
- Structured logs to stdout (captured by Docker/K8s)
- Per-run logs in working directory
- Centralized aggregation via Loki/ELK if needed
- Redis status messages ephemeral (72-hour retention)

### 🔥 VS Code Theme Integration (CRITICAL PATH)
**Started**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: In Progress - Phase 0 (Mapping Configuration)  
**Size**: Medium (6-8 days)  
**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Frontend Modernization Blocker  
**Owner**: AI Agents (Coordination)  
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251027_vscode_theme_integration/](docs/work-packages/20251027_vscode_theme_integration/)  
**Description**: Implement configurable VS Code theme integration to satisfy stakeholder demands for "more style" while preserving zero-aesthetic development philosophy.

**Objective**: Enable visual customization without developer burden through dynamic theme mapping system.

**Key Innovation**: Configurable `theme-mapping.json` allows stakeholders to fine-tune color assignments without touching code. `--reset-mapping` provides safety net.

**Deliverables**:
- ⏳ Phase 0: Configurable mapping system (`theme-mapping.json` + dynamic converter)
- ⏳ Phase 1: OneDark POC with theme switcher
- ⏳ Phase 2: 6 curated themes (Default Light/Dark, OneDark, GitHub Dark, Solarized Light/Dark)
- ⏳ Phase 3: User persistence (localStorage + cookie fallback)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Documentation and build pipeline integration
- ⏳ Phase 5: Rollout with analytics and feedback collection

**Strategic Value**:
- **Stakeholder empowerment**: Edit colors via JSON config, no code changes needed
- **Zero developer burden**: Pattern templates unchanged, stakeholders handle theming
- **WCAG AA compliance**: All shipped themes pass accessibility validation
- **Preserves zero-aesthetic**: Developers still make zero color decisions during implementation
- **Unblocks frontend modernization**: Addresses stakeholder "not enough style" concern

**Current Status**:
- Work package created with 5-phase implementation plan
- Feasibility analysis complete (moved to artifacts/)
- Configurable mapping architecture designed
- 12-theme catalog limit established to prevent bloat
- Safety mechanisms planned (--reset-mapping, --validate-only)

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 0: Create `theme-mapping.json` with default mappings
2. Update converter script to read mapping config dynamically
3. Add validation and reset flags for stakeholder safety
4. Test per-theme override mechanism
5. Document stakeholder editing guide

**Critical Path Justification**:
- Stakeholder review requested "more style" - blocking frontend modernization approval
- Low implementation cost (6-8 days) for high stakeholder value
- Enables self-service customization without ongoing developer burden
- Preserves core "zero-aesthetic" philosophy through external constraints

**Dependencies**: None (upstream dependencies satisfied: Pure.css integration, CSS variables, pattern catalog)

- ✅ wctl integration - 6 doc-* commands: doc-lint, doc-catalog, doc-toc, doc-mv, doc-refs, doc-bench
- ✅ CI/CD integration - docs-quality.yml workflow with SARIF upload, Rust checks, telemetry
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation - tools/README.markdown-tools.md, CI/CD strategy updates
- ✅ Telemetry collection active (started 2025-10-31, logs to telemetry/docs-quality.jsonl)

**Phase 4 Scope** (Pending Go/No-Go Decision 2025-11-18):
- 🔮 `search` - Full-text search with TF-IDF ranking (<500ms target)
- 🔮 Index builder with persistent caching (<5s rebuild target)
- 🔮 JSON output mode for programmatic consumption

**Current Status**:
- **RFC Decision Gate** (Due 2025-11-08): 4 decisions pending (link graph caching, CI bench cadence, release comms, Phase 4 scope validation)
- **Telemetry Collection** (Due 2025-11-18): Gathering baseline data (≥2 weeks from 2025-10-31) to validate Phase 4 justification
- **Integration Finalization** (Due 2025-11-08): Onboarding docs, release notes, RFC outcomes

**Strategic Value**: 
- **Delivered** (Phases 1-3): Reduces doc maintenance by ~70%, prevents broken links in CI, enables safe refactoring, improves link graph visibility
- **Potential** (Phase 4): Fast semantic search across 388+ docs, programmatic query support, reusable index for tooling integration

**Dependencies**: 
- Phase 4 blocked on: Telemetry data maturity (≥2 weeks), RFC decisions, Phase 4 open questions resolution

**Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate** (Nov 2-8): Resolve RFC decisions (4 decisions), finalize integration (onboarding docs, release notes)
2. **Phase 4 Gate** (Nov 18): Review telemetry data, resolve Phase 4 open questions (index storage, watch mode, UI integration, search patterns), make go/no-go decision
3. **If Phase 4 Greenlit**: Create Phase 4 work package structure, draft agent prompts, assign ownership, schedule M1 target (~Dec 6)

### NoDb ACID Transaction Update
**Completed**: 2025-10-25  
**Duration**: 1 day (planning only)  
**Status**: ❌ **CANCELLED - Unviable**  
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251024_nodb_acid_update/](docs/work-packages/20251024_nodb_acid_update/)  
**Description**: Proposed Redis-backed ACID transactions for NoDb controllers with intelligent event-driven cache invalidation.

**Outcome**: After architectural review, the proposed specification was deemed unviable. The approach introduced excessive complexity without sufficient benefit. NoDb's existing file-based state management with Redis locking remains the architectural pattern.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Redis transactions don't provide the durability guarantees needed for NoDb's file-first architecture
- Cache invalidation rules added complexity without addressing core concurrency patterns
- File-based state with explicit locking is simpler and more maintainable
- Future caching improvements should focus on read-through patterns, not transaction wrappers

---

### StatusStream Telemetry Cleanup
**Completed**: 2025-10-23  
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Link**: [docs/work-packages/20251023_statusstream_cleanup/](docs/work-packages/20251023_statusstream_cleanup/)  
**Description**: Replaced legacy WSClient shim with unified controlBase.attach_status_stream helper.

**Outcome**: Unified telemetry pipeline with no WSClient references; all controllers use StatusStream.

---

### Controller Modernization Documentation Backlog
