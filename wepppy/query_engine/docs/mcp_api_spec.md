# WEPPcloud Query Engine MCP API Specification (Moved)

This document now lives at the project root: `wepppy/query_engine/README.md`.

- The README includes the full MCP API overview, endpoint contracts, and workflow guidance.
- The machine-readable OpenAPI contract remains at `wepppy/query_engine/docs/mcp_openapi.yaml`.

Please update references to point to the new README location.
