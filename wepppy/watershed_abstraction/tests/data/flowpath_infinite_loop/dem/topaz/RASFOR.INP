C INPUT DATA FILE RASFOR.INP                                                  
C THIS INPUT DATA FILE CONTAINS THE PARAMETERS REQUIRED BY PROGRAM RASFOR.FOR 
C TO REFORMAT THE UNFORMATTED RASTER FILES PRODUCED BY DEDNM.                 
C******************************************************************************
C
C   THE FOLLOWING ARE THE REFORMATTING OPTIONS AVAILABLE WITH PROGRAM RASFOR: 
C
C  0 - ASCII FILE HAVING ONE VALUE PER RECORD.  THE ORDER OF THE VALUES
C      ARE: COLUMN FIRST, ROW SECOND; I.E. X(R,C) FOR COLUMNS 1 THROUGH NCOLUMN
C      (C=1,NCOLUMN), THIS FOR SUCCESSIVE ROWS 1 THROUGH NROW (R=1,NROW). 
C
C  1 - ASCII FILE IN 2-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY FORM.  THE FILE HAS ONE RECORD FOR 
C      EACH ROW OF DATA IN THE RASTER ARRAY.  THE VALUES WITHIN A RECORD ARE
C      IN INCREASING COLUMN ORDER; I.E  X(R,C) FOR COLUMNS 1 THROUGH NCOLUMN
C      (C=1,NCOLUMN) REPEATED FOR EACH ROW 1 THROUGH NROW (R=1,NROW).
C
C  2 - IDRISI (NOTE 1) 4.0 FORMAT.  THIS FORMAT PROVIDES THE RASTER FILES FOR 
C      THE COMMERCIAL GIS PACKAGE IDRISI (NOTE 1).  THE FILES COME IN PAIRS: 
C      ONE IMAGE FILE AND ONE CORRESPONDING DOCUMENTATION FILE.  THE IMAGE 
C      FILE IS A SINGLE VALUE PER RECORD FORMAT.
C      NOTE: THESE FILES CAN BE VIEWED DIRECTLY IN IDRISI 4.0 USING THE MODULE 
C            'COLOR A'.  HOWEVER, AUTOMATIC RECLASSIFICATION, GROUPING AND 
C             COLOR WRAPPING MAY AFFECT THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE DATA.
C            THE USER MUST PERFORM ADDITIONAL FILE MANIPULATIONS WITHIN IDRISI
C            TO DISPLAY THE DATA ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS AND NEEDS.
C
C  3 - ARC/INFO (NOTE 1) ASCIIGRID INPUT FORMAT.  THIS FORMAT PROVIDES AN ASCII
C      FILE WHICH CAN BE USED AS AN INPUT FORMAT FOR USE WITH THE COMMERCIAL
C      GIS PACKAGE ARC/INFO (NOTE 1).  THIS FORMAT CAN BE USED WITH THE 
C      ARC/INFO COMMAND ASCIIGRID TO GET THE DATA INTO ARC/INFO'S GRID FORMAT.
C      THE FILE IS IN ASCII FORMAT WITH A HEADER CONTAINING FILE INFORMATION
C      DATA.  THE RASTER DATA IS IN 2-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY FORM.  THE FILE HAS 
C      ONE RECORD FOR EACH ROW IN THE RASTER ARRAY.  THE VALUES WITHIN ONE 
C      RECORD ARE IN INCREASING COLUN ORDER; I.E.  COLUMNS 1 THROUGH NCOLUMN 
C      (C=1,NCOLUMN), REPEATED FOR EACH ROW 1 THROUGH NROW (R=1,NROW).
C      MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COLUMNS ALLOWED BY THE FORMAT STATEMENTS IN THIS 
C      MODULE IS 12500.
