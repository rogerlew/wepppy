The everyuuid.com site (a humorous project claiming to list all possible version 4 UUIDs, of which there are about 5.3 sextillion) implements virtual scrolling entirely through custom JavaScript, without relying on third-party libraries. This is necessary because rendering such an enormous "list" traditionally would require an impossibly tall page (trillions of trillions of pixels high), which browsers can't handle due to limitations in scroll position and DOM rendering. Instead, the site fakes an infinite scroll by generating and displaying UUIDs on the fly based on a virtual position, while keeping the actual page height fixed to the browser viewport.

### Key Techniques for Virtual Scrolling
- **Fixed Viewport and Virtual Position Tracking**: The page's scrollable area is locked to the height of the user's browser window (viewport). A virtual scroll position is maintained as a BigInt (to handle enormous numbers beyond standard JavaScript limits). This position updates in response to user inputs like mouse wheel scrolls, touch gestures, or keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End). The site doesn't use the browser's native scrolling; it intercepts these events and simulates movement by recalculating what to render.
  
- **Event Handling for Scrolling**: Scroll actions are captured via event listeners. For example:
  - Mouse wheel and touch events adjust the virtual position incrementally.
  - Keyboard hotkeys trigger larger jumps (e.g., ArrowDown might advance by one line, while PageDown jumps by a full viewport's worth).
  - An easing animation smooths transitions using `requestAnimationFrame` for fluid movement. Here's a simplified code example from the implementation:
    ```javascript
    const startPosition = virtualPosition;
    const startTime = performance.now();
    const duration = 300; // ms

    const animate = () => {
      const currentTime = performance.now();
      const elapsed = currentTime - startTime;
      const progress = Math.min(elapsed / duration, 1);
      const easeProgress = 1 - Math.pow(1 - progress, 4); // Ease-out quart
      const currentPos = startPosition + ((targetPosition - startPosition) * BigInt(Math.floor(easeProgress * 1000))) / 1000n;
      setVirtualPosition(currentPos);

      if (progress < 1) {
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      } else {
        setVirtualPosition(targetPosition);
      }
    };

    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    ```
    This creates a natural scrolling feel without relying on CSS animations or browser scrollbars.

- **On-the-Fly Rendering of Visible Items**: Only a small buffer of UUIDs (those visible in the viewport plus some padding for smooth scrolling) are rendered as DOM elements. As the virtual position changes, the site dynamically generates and inserts the corresponding UUIDs into the view, removing off-screen ones to keep performance high. This avoids creating billions of nodes, which would crash the browser.

- **UUID Generation**: UUIDs aren't pre-stored; they're computed deterministically from the virtual position using a bijective (one-to-one) mapping. This ensures the same position always yields the same UUID, allowing consistent "scrolling" and searching. The process involves:
  - Splitting the position into 61-bit blocks (left and right halves).
  - Applying a custom Feistel cipher (a reversible encryption-like scrambling) over multiple rounds to mix bits pseudo-randomly while preserving bijectivity. Each round includes XOR with constants, bit shifts, and multiplication:
    ```javascript
    const ROUND_CONSTANTS = [
      BigInt("0x47f5417d6b82b5d1"),
      // Additional constants for other rounds...
    ];

    function feistelRound(block, round) {
      let mixed = block;
      mixed ^= ROUND_CONSTANTS[round] & ((BigInt(1) << BigInt(61)) - BigInt(1));
      mixed = ((mixed << BigInt(7)) | (mixed >> BigInt(54))) & ((BigInt(1) << BigInt(61)) - BigInt(1));
      mixed = (mixed * BigInt("0x6c8e944d1f5aa3b7")) & ((BigInt(1) << BigInt(61)) - BigInt(1));
      mixed = ((mixed << BigInt(13)) | (mixed >> BigInt(48))) & ((BigInt(1) << BigInt(61)) - BigInt(1));
      return mixed;
    }
    ```
  - Combining the scrambled bits into a valid UUID v4 format (e.g., setting the version bits to '4' and variant to '8'-'b'). The full mapping function looks like:
    ```javascript
    function indexToUUID(index) {
      let initialLeft = BigInt(index) >> BigInt(61);
      let initialRight = BigInt(index) & ((BigInt(1) << BigInt(61)) - BigInt(1));
      let { left, right } = feistelEncrypt(initialLeft, initialRight); // Applies multiple rounds
      // Bit manipulation to form UUID string, e.g., inserting hyphens and hex formatting
      // ...
    }
    ```
    The reverse (UUID to index) enables the search feature: users input a UUID, and the site "scrolls" to its position by decoding it back to an index.

- **Searching**: Search jumps directly to a UUID's virtual position by reversing the mapping (UUID string to BigInt index via Feistel decryption), then animating the scroll to that spot. This gives the illusion of navigating a massive pre-existing list.

This custom approach draws inspiration from virtual scrolling libraries (like those for infinite lists) but is built from scratch to handle BigInt-scale positions and bijective generation, making the site feel like an endless, searchable scroll through all UUIDs without storing or loading any data upfront.
