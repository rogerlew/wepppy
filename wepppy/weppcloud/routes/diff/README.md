# WEPPcloud Diff Viewer

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm the diff viewer living in `wepppy/weppcloud/routes/diff`. I was crafted to turn side-by-side file comparisons into a fast, pleasant experienceâ€”even when you throw hundreds of thousands of lines or deeply tokenized parameter files my way.

## Feature Highlights

- **High-performance client diffing** â€“ A Myers-based line diff combined with token-level highlights keeps differences precise without shipping raw files to the server.
- **Virtualized rendering** â€“ Only the viewportâ€™s rows are in the DOM at any moment, and implements virtual scrolling with buffering, so scrolling through large files stays smooth.
- **Smart layout** â€“ Line-number gutters stay fixed, panes stay balanced, and long lines are clipped to their columns while horizontal scrolling reveals details when you need them.
- **Diff-only toggle** â€“ Instantly collapse identical rows to focus on what changed and jump back to the full view with a single click.
- **Dynamic sizing** â€“ Column widths adapt to the content while respecting the viewport, and sticky header/toolbar controls remain accessible at all times.
- **Robust tokenization** â€“ Differences inside structured parameter files (e.g., WEPP soils) are highlighted token-by-token instead of blobbed together for a line.

## Processing Flow

1. **Route bootstrap** (`diff.py` â†’ `comparer.htm`)
   - The Flask route resolves the left and right file URLs, injects metadata (run IDs, config, download links), and serves the minimal HTML shell.

2. **Client initialization** (`diff_viewer.js`)
   - On `DOMContentLoaded`, the viewer fetches both files in parallel and normalizes line endings/tabs.  
   - A Myers diff produces line-level operations; contiguous insert/delete pairs become `replace` blocks.

3. **Token highlighting**
   - For every `replace`, a secondary Myers pass runs over tokens (split on whitespace and punctuation) to wrap fine-grained insert/delete spans.

4. **Column sizing + layout**
   - Estimated character widths drive CSS custom properties that size both panes and gutters. Widths are clamped so long lines never shove the opposite column off screen.

5. **Virtualized render loop**
   - The renderer maintains start/end row indexes based on scroll position plus configurable overscan.  
   - `requestAnimationFrame` throttles updates, and the spacer element expands to the total virtual height.

6. **Interaction affordances**
   - The diff-only toggle swaps the rendered row set, re-measures column widths, and scrolls back to the top.  
   - Resizing the window recalculates widths and recenters the horizontal scroll.

## Working With the Viewer

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `diff.py` | Flask blueprint delivering the diff comparer shell. |
| `templates/comparer.htm` | HTML + CSS responsible for layout, sticky toolbar, and overall styling. |
| `static/js/diff_viewer.js` | All client logic: fetching, diffing, virtualization, token highlighting, and UI wiring. |

### Parameters Worth Knowing (`diff_viewer.js`)

- `ROW_HEIGHT`, `OVERSCAN_ROWS` â€“ tune virtualization density. If you adjust the CSS row height, keep these in sync.
- `MAX_COLUMN_WIDTH_CHARS`, `COLUMN_PADDING_PX`, `PANE_GAP_PX` â€“ control horizontal layout behaviour.
- `TOKEN_BOUNDARY_REGEX`, `TOKEN_DIFF_MAX_LENGTH` â€“ tweak token level diff sensitivity.
- `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` â€“ cap download wait times if repositories are slow.

### Layout Tips

- **Toolbar + viewport spacing**: The toolbar is absolutely positioned; `diff-root` adds top padding equal to the toolbar height so the scroll region never overlaps. If you restyle the toolbar height, update the CSS variable or the `ResizeObserver` will handle it for you.
- **Gutters**: Both line-number gutters are sticky and share the same width variable. If long run IDs require more digits, `applyLineNumberWidthHint` automatically widens them.
- **Column clipping**: Each pane uses `overflow: hidden` with `min-width: max-content` for the inner content so long lines are clipped but still accessible via horizontal scroll.

### Virtualization Pain Points

- **Row height mismatches**: The renderer samples the first visible row and updates the `--diff-row-height` variable if it detects a deviation. If you radically change row styling, make sure that sample still represents the final height.
- **Overscan trade-offs**: Large `OVERSCAN_ROWS` smooth out fast scrolling but increase DOM size. Too small and you risk white gaps if the browser canâ€™t render in time.
- **Diff-only mode**: When toggling back to full view we recalc column widths so the layout doesnâ€™t jump. If you add new filters, remember to trigger `applyColumnWidthHints`.

### Extending Functionality

- **Additional metadata**: Pass extra fields through the bootstrap object in `comparer.htm` and read them inside `diff_viewer.js` for custom badges or context banners.
- **Alternate diff algorithms**: The Myers implementation is modularâ€”drop in a different `diffCore` if you need patience diff or histogram diff, but ensure `buildRows` still receives the same operation shape.
- **Theme adjustments**: Most colours/sizes live in CSS custom properties at the top of `comparer.htm`. Adjust them once and the entire viewer adapts.

## Final Notes

This viewer was purpose-built for WEPPcloud workflows, but the architecture is generic: asynchronous file fetch, Myers diff, virtualized rendering, and a responsive layout. Feel free to iterateâ€”tweak the parameters, plug in new renderers, or wrap it in your own tooling. If something becomes sluggish or misaligned, the hotspots above are the first places to look.
