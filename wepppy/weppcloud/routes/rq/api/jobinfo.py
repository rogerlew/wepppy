## Job Status
# The status of a job can be one of the following:
#
# queued: 
#   The default status for created jobs, except for those that have dependencies, 
#   which will be created as deferred. These jobs have been placed in a queue and are ready to be executed.

# finished: 
#   The job has finished execution and is available through the finished job registry.
# failed: 
#   Jobs that encountered errors during execution or expired before being executed.
# started: 
#   The job has started execution. This status includes the job execution support mechanisms, such as setting the worker name and setting up heartbeat information.
# deferred: 
#   The job is not ready for execution because its dependencies have not finished successfully yet.
# scheduled: 
#   Jobs created to run at a future date or jobs that are retried after a retry interval.
# stopped: 
#   The job was stopped because the worker was stopped.
# canceled: 
#   The job has been manually canceled and will not be executed, even if it is part of a dependency chain.
