# Climate Input File Specification

- Line 1:

  CLIGEN version number - real (datver)
    - 0.0 - use actual storm ip values in this file
    - 4.0 - WEPP will internally multiply ip by a factor of 0.70 to compensate for the steady-state erosion model assumption.
    - 4.30 â€“ Reference to which version of CLIGEN generated this file
    - 5.30 - Reference to which version of CLIGEN generated this file

- Line 2:

  a) simulation mode - integer (itemp)
    - 1 - continuous
    - 2 - single storm

  b) breakpoint data flag - integer (ibrkpt)
    - 0 - no breakpoint data used
    - 1 - breakpoint data used
