### Explanation of Conversion from `srad` (W/m²) and `dayl` (s/day) to Langleys per Day (l/day)

This markdown explains the step-by-step conversion of shortwave radiation (`srad`), measured in watts per square meter (W/m²), and daylight duration (`dayl`), in seconds per day (s/day), to langleys per day (l/day). A langley is a unit of energy equal to one calorie per square centimeter (cal/cm²).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Variables
- **`srad` (W/m²)**: Average shortwave radiation flux during daylight.
    - Since 1 watt (W) equals 1 joule per second (J/s), this can be written as:
    ```
    srad = J / (s · m²)
    ```
- **`dayl` (s/day)**: Duration of daylight in seconds per day.

---

#### Step 2: Calculating Total Energy in Joules per Square Meter (J/m²)
To find the total energy received per square meter over the daylight period, multiply `srad` by `dayl`:
```
Total Energy = srad × dayl
```
- **Units**:
    ```
    (J / (s · m²)) × (s/day) = J / (m² · day)
    ```
- This gives the total energy in joules per square meter per day (J/m²/day).

#### Step 3: Understanding Langleys
- A langley (l) is defined as:
    ```
    1 l = 1 cal/cm²
    ```
- For daily totals, langleys per day (l/day) is:
    ```
    cal / (cm² · day)
    ```

---

#### Step 4: Converting J/m² to cal/cm²
To convert the total energy from J/m² to cal/cm²:
- **Energy conversion**:
    ```
    1 cal = 4.184 J  so  1 J = 1 / 4.184 cal
    ```
- **Area conversion**:
    ```
    1 m² = 10,000 cm²  so  1 / m² = 1 / 10,000 cm⁻²
    ```
- Therefore, the conversion factor is:
    ```
    Total Energy in cal/cm² = (Total Energy in J/m²) × (1 / 4.184 cal/J) × (1 / 10,000 m²/cm²)
                            = (Total Energy in J/m²) / (4.184 × 10,000)
                            = (Total Energy in J/m²) / 41,840
    ```

---

#### Step 5: Final Conversion Formula
The formula to convert to langleys per day is:
```
l/day = (srad × dayl) / 41,840
```
- **Units check**:
    ```
    [(J / (s · m²)) × (s/day)] / [41,840 (J/m²)/(cal/cm²)] = (J / (m² · day)) × (cal/cm²) / (J/m²)
                                                            = cal / (cm² · day)
    ```
- This confirms the result is in langleys per day (cal/cm²/day).

---

#### Conclusion
The conversion correctly computes the total daily shortwave radiation in langleys per day by:
1. Calculating total energy in J/m² using `srad` (W/m²) × `dayl` (s/day).
2. Converting J/m² to l/day by dividing by 41,840, which accounts for both energy (J to cal) and area (m² to cm²) unit conversions.
