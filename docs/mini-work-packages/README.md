# Mini Work Packages

Use this directory for lightweight documentation that sits between an ad-hoc note and a full work package. Mini packages are ideal for:

- Short-lived efforts that still benefit from a written scope or retrospective.
- Prompt drafts and validation notes that do not warrant the full `work-packages/` structure.
- Follow-up context once a work package closes and only a quick postscript is required.

Create a markdown file at the root for active work (for example, `20251028_controller_cleanup.md`). When the effort finishes, move it under `completed/` so it remains discoverable without cluttering the active list.
