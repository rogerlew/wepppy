## Recommendations

### High Priority Actions

1. **Critical READMEs** — These files need immediate attention:

   - `tests/README.md` (score: 0)
     - Missing: title, overview, code example, AGENTS.md link
   - `weppcloudR/templates/README.md` (score: 10)
     - Missing: overview, code example, AGENTS.md link
   - `wepppy/all_your_base/README.md` (score: 10)
     - Missing: overview, code example, AGENTS.md link
   - `wepppy/eu/soils/esdac/readme.md` (score: 10)
     - Missing: overview, code example, AGENTS.md link
   - `wepppy/microservices/README.md` (score: 20)
     - Missing: overview, code example

2. **Improvement Candidates** — These would benefit from enhancement:

   - `wctl/README.md` (score: 50)
   - `weppcloudR/README.md` (score: 40)
   - `wepppy/nodb/mods/omni/README.md` (score: 45)
   - `wepppy/query_engine/README.md` (score: 50)
   - `wepppy/weppcloud/README.md` (score: 45)

### Suggested Actions

1. **Use the template** — Copy `docs/templates/README_TEMPLATE.md` for new READMEs
2. **Add examples** — Include at least one working code snippet
3. **Link to AGENTS.md** — Add 'See also' reference at the top
4. **Document APIs** — List key classes, functions, and their purposes
5. **Add architecture** — Explain design patterns and integration points

### Best Practices

- Start with the header and overview
- Add one working example minimum
- Document the most commonly used APIs first
- Link to related documentation instead of duplicating
- Keep content current as code evolves
