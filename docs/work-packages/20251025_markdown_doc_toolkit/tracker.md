## Decisions Log

### 2025-10-25: Work Package Created

**Decision:** Build `markdown-doc` as standalone Rust CLI  
**Rationale:**
- Leverages existing `markdown-extract`/`markdown-edit` patterns
- Rust provides performance for large doc sets (388+ files)
- Standalone tool = reusable across projects
- Agent-executable by design

**Alternatives considered:**
- Python tool: Rejected (slower, adds dependency)
- Shell scripts: Rejected (complex logic, hard to maintain)
- Extend existing tools: Rejected (different concerns, keep focused)

**Participants:** Roger, Claude

---

### 2025-10-25: `mv` Command Added to Scope

**Decision:** Include `markdown-doc mv` in initial release  
**Rationale:**
- High-value feature for refactoring workflows
- Reduces friction for documentation reorganization
- Prevents broken links when restructuring
- Enables agents to safely move docs

**Implementation notes:**
- Dry-run mode required (preview before apply)
- Atomic operations (all updates succeed or all fail)
- Backup files by default
- Clear exit codes for automation

**Participants:** Roger, Claude

---

### 2025-10-25: Lead Developer Review Integrated

**Decision:** Narrow MVP scope to single vertical slice: `catalog` + `lint broken-links` + config loader  
**Rationale:**
- Original Phase 1 was too broad (multi-quarter roadmap feel)
- Single vertical slice proves end-to-end workflow faster
- Enables early feedback before building additional rules

**Changes made:**
- Moved `toc` command to Phase 2 (not MVP-critical)
- Added selective scanning flags (`--path`, `--staged`) to MVP scope
- Specified output formats (plain text, JSON, SARIF) for agent/human/CI consumers
- Added severity tuning system (ignore lists, downgradeable severities) to Phase 2
- Clarified `validate` vs `lint required-sections` relationship
- Documented concurrency safety (atomic temp-file writes, no global locks)
- Added configuration precedence and fallback behavior
- Deferred `search` command pending acceptance criteria (latency, ranking, snippet quality)
- Updated milestones with concrete acceptance criteria

**Implementation notes:**
- `lint` and `validate` both read `[schemas]` config but serve different purposes
- `lint`: Fast incremental checks (pre-commit suitable)
- `validate`: Deep template conformance (CI gate for critical files)

**Participants:** Roger, Claude (integrating codex feedback)

---

### 2025-10-25: Scope Boundaries Clarified

**Decision:** Move post-MVP commands to "Out of Scope (Future Phases)" section  
**Rationale:**
- `search`, `mv`, `refs`, `toc`, `validate` appeared under "In Scope" but belong to Phase 2-4
- Only `catalog` + `lint broken-links` + config loader constitute MVP/first release
- Clearer separation prevents confusion about first milestone gates

**Changes made:**
- "In Scope" section now lists only MVP components
- "Out of Scope" organized by phase (Phase 2: Quality Gates, Phase 3: Refactoring, Phase 4: Intelligence)
- Success Criteria split into "MVP Exit" vs "Full Toolkit"
- MVP exit criteria now accurately reflect first release scope (no Phase 2/3 features)

**Participants:** Roger (review feedback), Claude

## Risks & Issues

## Verification Checklist

### Before Release

- [ ] All commands have `--help` output
- [ ] All commands have exit code documentation
- [ ] Dry-run mode works for destructive operations
- [ ] Configuration file schema documented
- [ ] CI integration example provided
- [ ] README.md includes quickstart
- [ ] Performance benchmarked on 388 files
- [ ] Error messages are actionable
- [ ] Agent workflows documented

### Quality Gates

- [ ] Zero panics on invalid input
- [ ] Handles missing files gracefully
- [ ] UTF-8 validation on all reads
- [ ] Atomic file operations (temp + rename)
- [ ] Backup files created for destructive ops
- [ ] Exit codes consistent across commands
- [ ] Stderr for errors, stdout for data

## Agent Handoff Notes

### Context for Next Agent

When resuming this work:
1. Read `package.md` for full scope and objectives
2. Review existing `markdown-extract`/`markdown-edit` source for patterns
3. Check `/workdir/wepppy` for current markdown file count/structure
4. Validate `.markdown-doc.toml` schema against wepppy's needs

### Open Questions

- Should `catalog` include file metadata (size, last modified)? — **Deferred to Phase 2**
- Should `lint` support custom rules via plugins? — **Deferred, start with built-in rules**
- Should `mv` handle git mv automatically? — **Deferred, manual git integration for now**
- ~~Should search support regex patterns?~~ — **Answered: Search deferred pending acceptance criteria**
- ~~How to handle false positives in lint?~~ — **Answered: Severity tuning + ignore lists in Phase 2**
- ~~What output formats for CI/agents?~~ — **Answered: JSON and SARIF in MVP**

### Implementation Notes

- Use `pulldown-cmark` for markdown parsing (proven in existing tools)
- Consider `ignore` crate for .gitignore-aware file walking
- Use `clap` for CLI parsing (consistent with Rust ecosystem)
- Mirror exit code conventions from `markdown-edit`
