# Controller View Cleanup Findings

## Snapshot
- Verified every control included by `runs0_pure.htm` has a live controller in `wepppy/weppcloud/controllers_js/`; no missing bindings were found.
- Legacy Bootstrap-era views that extend `controls/_base.htm` are no longer referenced by Flask routes or templates—17 templates (plus 15 advanced-option partials) can be archived.
- Non-runs0 templates that remain in service (`archive_console_control.htm`, `fork_console_control.htm`, report views, etc.) were catalogued so we avoid accidental removal.
- Existing documentation (notably `docs/ui-docs/control-ui-styling/control-inventory.md`) still references several legacy templates and will need an update once cleanup lands.

### Run Shell Includes
| Template | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `controls/poweruser_panel.htm` | Preflight + admin shortcuts | Still tied to `preflight.js` and report templates. |
| `controls/unitizer_modal.htm` | Unit conversion modal | Consumed by `input-unit-converters.js`; embeds `controls/unitizer.htm`. |

## Shared Partials & Supporting Templates
- `controls/modify_landuse.htm` and `controls/modify_rangeland_cover.htm` live under the map tabset and are wired through `LanduseModify`/`RangelandCoverModify`.
- `controls/map/rhem_hillslope_visualizations.htm` and `controls/map/wepp_hillslope_visualizations.htm` provide the optional hillslope overlays toggled by the map controller.
- `controls/wepp_pure_advanced_options/*.htm` (15 files) are included from `wepp_pure.htm` and remain active.
- `controls/climate_monthlies.htm` is rendered by the climate blueprint for the monthlies panel (AJAX response).
- `controls/edit_csv.htm` is served by `nodb_api/disturbed_bp.py` for CSV-in-place edits.

## Templates Still Used Outside runs0
- `controls/archive_console_control.htm` – rendered by `routes/archive_dashboard`.
- `controls/fork_console_control.htm` – rendered by the fork console route.
- `controls/rhem_reports.htm` – used by `nodb_api/rhem_bp.py`.
- `controls/wepp_reports.htm` – used by `nodb_api/wepp_bp.py`.
- `controls/unitizer_modal.htm` – additionally referenced by `templates/ui_showcase/component_gallery.htm`.

## Legacy / Orphan Templates (no runtime references)

> All entries above were validated with `rg -l 'controls/<name>.htm'` and `rg -n '<name>.htm'`; only documentation files surfaced for these templates.

## Documentation Updates Needed
- `docs/ui-docs/control-ui-styling/control-inventory.md` – drop references to legacy `_base` templates and confirm Pure coverage.
- `docs/ui-docs/control-ui-styling/control-components.md` and related mod-specific plans – flag that Bootstrap templates have been retired or moved to archive storage.
- `wepppy/weppcloud/controllers_js/README.md` – update narrative snippets that still cite `wepp.htm`, `rangeland_cover.htm`, etc., to prevent confusion for future agents.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Move the orphaned `_base` templates (and their advanced-option includes) into an archival folder under `docs/work-packages/20251023_frontend_integration/legacy_controls/` or delete them outright after doc updates.
2. Regenerate `controllers.js` after template removal (`python wepppy/weppcloud/controllers_js/build_controllers_js.py`) and rerun the Pure controls render smoke test (`wctl run "pytest tests/weppcloud/routes/test_pure_controls_render.py"`).
3. Update the documentation set listed above so the control inventory reflects only live templates.
4. Announce the cleanup in the work-package retrospective (`docs/work-packages/20251023_frontend_integration/lessons_learned.md`) once merged.

## Commands Audited
- `rg -l "controls/<template>.htm"` and `rg -n "<template>.htm"` across the repo to trace runtime references.
- `sed -n` inspections of `runs0_pure.htm`, supporting templates, and controller modules for cross-checking.
