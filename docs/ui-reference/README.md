# WEPPcloud UI visual references

Use this directory to store lightweight screenshots or GIFs that reinforce the style guide. Keep each asset small (webp/png under ~200 KB) and pair it with a short caption in this README so future contributors know what “good” looks like.

## Capture checklist
- `header-light.png`: Base layout shell showing the Pure header, toolbar, and container spacing.
- `form-light.png`: Pure form with labels, helper text, and focus outlines.
- `table-pagination-light.png`: `.wc-table` with `.wc-pagination` demonstrating hover/current states.
- `status-panel-light.png`: `.wc-status` inside a `.wc-panel` for success, attention, and critical messaging.
- `tooltip-light.png`: `.wc-tooltip` hovering near an icon with text bubble visible.
- `dashboard-dark.png`: Dark-mode rendering of stacked panels to validate the token remapping.

Add more files as new shared components land (e.g., diff viewers). Update the list with the filename, date captured, and the template(s) represented.
