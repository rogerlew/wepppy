# controllers_js Modernization Retrospective
> Historical record of the jQuery → helper-first migration in `wepppy/weppcloud/controllers_js/`.

## Current Status
- **Modern controllers**: Every controller now relies on helper modules (`WCDom`, `WCForms`, `WCHttp`, `WCEvents`) and `controlBase.attach_status_stream`. No module instantiates `WSClient`, and the bundle no longer depends on global `jQuery`.
- **Telemetry**: Queue lifecycle, stack traces, and trigger events run exclusively through `StatusStream`. `controlBase` exposes a single adapter for controllers, handling spinner ticks, DOM updates, and fallbacks.
- **Helper ecosystem**: `dom.js`, `forms.js`, `http.js`, `events.js`, and `status_stream.js` are the canonical APIs. Controller README and AGENTS files describe these surfaces; Jest suites exercise them.
- **Templates**: Pure templates expose `data-*` hooks so controllers bind with `WCDom.delegate`. Remaining inline `$(...)` snippets live in the UI restyling backlog and are tracked separately.

## Migration Timeline (2024‑2025)
1. Authored shared helpers and refactored early controllers (ash, climate, landuse).
2. Consolidated telemetry by moving `WSClient` logic into `controlBase.attach_status_stream`.
3. Updated remaining controllers (soil, treatments, rhem, etc.) to the helper-first pattern.
4. Removed `ws_client.js`, rewrote controller Jest suites, and refreshed documentation.

## Lessons Learned
- Bootstrap helpers first; it avoided bespoke DOM code in each controller.
- Provide parity before deleting legacy pieces—StatusStream adopted WSClient features, then we removed the shim without regressions.
- Per-controller plans were invaluable during execution but should be archived once the migration is complete to reduce doc sprawl.

## Open Follow-ups
- Continue sweeping templates for legacy jQuery usage and move the remaining cases into helper-friendly macros.
- Keep `controller_foundations.md`, `controllers_js/README.md`, and `controllers_js/AGENTS.md` aligned with helper API changes.
- Archive or condense per-controller migration plans via the `docs/work-packages/controller-modernization-docs.md` backlog.

This retrospective replaces the old “jQuery Removal” roadmap. Treat earlier revisions as historical context; new work should reference the helper-first architecture described here.
